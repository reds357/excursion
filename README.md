Project Title: excursion

## Description:
This is a mock-up website created to fulfill project requirements for Codecademy's learning GitHub course. This was an exercise in creating a quick project and managing the process from start to finish utilizing Git and GitHub. The website is a simple advertisement.   

## Features:
There are not really any features, as this is mainly a simple webpage with very little CSS. I suppose you could say that the cell phone video on the page is a feature.

The redline for this project is included in the images folder. 

## License:
